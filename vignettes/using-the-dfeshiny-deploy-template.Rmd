When developing DFE Shiny dashboards, it’s common to want a consistent,
simple, and secure way to deploy applications to platforms such as
ShinyApps.io or the new DfE hosting platform. This article shows how to
use the dfeshiny reusable workflow template for GitHub Actions, with
parameters defined in a separate YAML file to minimize duplication and
speed up development.

## Overview

1.  **Have a `deploy_parameters.yaml`**: Store all your deployment
    parameters, including the app name, environment toggles (e.g.,
    `install_terra_dependencies`), and extra R packages to install.

2.  **Minimal Local Workflow**: Reference the *remote* reusable workflow
    (stored in another repository) from your local
    `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`.

3.  **Secrets Management**: Ensure your repository has the required
    secrets (e.g., `SHINYAPPS_TOKEN` and `SHINYAPPS_SECRET`) set up
    under *Settings \> Secrets and variables*.

## 1. Create a `deploy_parameters.yaml`

At the root of your project, add a file called
`deploy_parameters.yaml`.\
Below is an example with optional parameters:

```{yaml}
dashboard_name: "my-cool-dashboard"
deploy_target: "shinyapps"
install_terra_dependencies: true
install_unit_dependencies: true
extra_packages:
  - sf
  - data.table
  - DT
```

-   `dashboard_name`: Your application’s name on ShinyApps (or other
    hosting platform).

-   `deploy_target`: Where you want to deploy (e.g., `"shinyapps"`).

-   `install_terra_dependencies`: Whether to install the GDAL libraries
    (important for certain spatial packages like `sf` which is itself a
    dependency of map plotting packages such as `leaflet`).

-   `install_unit_dependencies`: Whether to install the linux libraries
    (important for the `units` package).

-   `extra_packages`: A list of additional packages to install beyond
    what you have in your `renv.lock`.

## 2. Set Up Your Local Workflow

In your local `.github/workflows/` folder, create or edit a
file—commonly named `deploy.yaml`. This file defines **only** the
trigger conditions (which branches to watch) and then calls the remote
reusable workflow.

Here is a minimal example:

```{yaml}
name: Deploy Dashboard

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - development

jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: dfe-analytical-services/dfeshiny/.github/workflows/deploy-dashboard-template.yaml@main
    with:
      parameter_file: deploy_parameters.yaml
```

-   `on: push`… ensures this workflow runs whenever code is pushed to
    `main` or `development`.

-   `uses: dfe-analytical-services/dfeshiny-deploy-templates…` points to
    the remote repo and file containing the actual deployment steps.

-   `with: parameter_file: deploy_parameters.yaml` tells the remote
    workflow which file to parse for parameters.

## 3. Secrets and Permissions

Before your deployment can succeed, you need to set the relevant secrets
in your local repository. These secrets are **not** shared automatically
across repos, so you must create them in your project’s *Settings \>
Secrets and variables \> Actions*:

-   **SHINYAPPS_TOKEN**

-   **SHINYAPPS_SECRET**

## 4. How the Template Works

Once you commit your `deploy.yaml` and `deploy_parameters.yaml`, the
GitHub Actions runner will:

1.  **Check Out the Code** – Pulls your repository code and the
    `deploy_parameters.yaml`.

2.  **Parse Parameters** – Uses a tool like `yq` to read
    `deploy_parameters.yaml`:

    -   `dashboard_name`

    -   `deploy_target`

    -   etc.

3.  **Install Dependencies** – Optionally installs GDAL libraries if
    `install_terra_dependencies: true`.

4.  **Restore R Dependencies** – If your project uses `renv`, it runs
    `renv::restore()` to ensure your local library is consistent.

5.  **Install Extra Packages** – Installs any packages listed in
    `extra_packages`.

6.  **Deploy** – Calls the appropriate deployment method based on
    `deploy_target`.

    -   For ShinyApps.io, it uses `rsconnect::deployApp()`.

## Summary

Using a reusable GitHub Actions workflow template:

-   **Reduces complexity** of dashboards deployments - you only maintain
    a minimal local config .

-   **Ensures** **consistent deployment** practices across your
    dashboards.

-   Makes it easy to **update** deployments across your dashboards with
    minimal changes in each repository.

With these steps, you can quickly set up your dashboards to deploy on
push—whether that’s to ShinyApps.io or a future DfE platform—while
keeping all your deployment logic in a single, centralized workflow
template.
