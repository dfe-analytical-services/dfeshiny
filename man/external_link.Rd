\usage{
external_link(href, link_text, add_warning = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{href}{URL that you want the link to point to}

\item{link_text}{Text that will appear describing your link, must be
descriptive of the page you are linking to. Vague text like 'click here' or
'here' will cause an error, as will ending in a full stop. Leading and
trailing white space will be automatically trimmed. If the string is shorter
than 7 characters a console warning will be thrown. There is no way to hush
this other than providing more detail.}

\item{add_warning}{Boolean for adding "(opens in new tab)" at the end of the
link text to warn users of the behaviour. Be careful and consider
accessibility before removing the visual warning.}

\description{
It is commonplace for external links to open in a new tab, and when we do
this we should be careful...

This function automatically adds the following to your link:
\itemize{
\item \code{target="_blank"} to open in new tab
\item \code{rel="noopener noreferrer"} to prevent \href{https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Reverse_Tabnabbing}{reverse tabnabbing}
}

By default this function also adds "(opens in new tab)" to your link text
to warn users of the behaviour.

This also adds "This link opens in a new tab" as a visually hidden span
element within the HTML outputted to warn non-visual users of the behaviour.

The function will error if you end with a full stop, give a warning for
particularly short link text and will automatically trim any leading or
trailing white space inputted into link_text.

If you are displaying lots of links together and want to save space by
avoiding repeating (opens in new tab), then you can set add_warning = FALSE
and add a line of text above all of the links saying something like 'The
following links open in a new tab'.

Intentionally basic wrapper for HTML anchor elements making it easier to
create safe external links with standard and accessible behaviour. For more
