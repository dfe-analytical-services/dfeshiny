# dfeshiny 0.2.0

## New features

* A module is now provided to produce a standardised cookie consent banner and 
implement the associated functionality. The server part is 
`cookie_banner_server()` and the ui part is `cookie_banner_ui()`. In addition, 
`dfe_cookie_script()` is provided to implement the necessary javascript.

## Improvements

* Implemented basic unit testing (currently just on e-mail validation) and UI 
testing using a test dashboard;

* Instructions within the package README.md on how to install `dfeshiny` have
been updated.
